# KDL Primitives

This crate contains parsers and other low-level helper types for handling KDL documents. It should be considered a complete but highly skeletal KDL implementation, suitable for use by KDL crate authors to provide higher level access to KDL data. Unless you're working on a KDL implementation, you should probably not be using this crate.
